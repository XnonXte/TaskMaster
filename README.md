# TaskMaster

Todo app made with React and bootstrap.

## Several Todos

- Current implementation relies on localStorage for storing data, we might use a server in the future.
- Might add user auth if that ever happens?
- Add the option to add labels (i.e., important or less-important).
- Currently it works only on desktop, maybe fix that I guess?
